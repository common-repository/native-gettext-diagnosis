Diagnose a server's capabilities to use the native gettext extension for translations.

== Description ==

WordPress uses various methods to convert the original english text strings into the target language. Using the server's built-in native gettext functions is considerably faster than their PHP equivalent. This plugin checks whether a webserver offers this optional gettext capabilities to WordPress.
